                        My name is Solanki Nehal Shailesh, and I am 20 years old. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech
                        degree in Computer Science
                        Engineering with a specialization in Bioinformatics at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT),
                        Vellore Campus. I have a
                        strong interest in technology and enjoy learning about how computers and software work. Along
                        with my studies, I am an
                        active member of the ISTE Core team at VIT, which allows me to engage in various academic
                        activities and develop my
                        leadership skills. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy reading books and practicing meditation,
                        as they help me relax
                        and stay focused on my goals.</p>

            I have always tried to do well in school. Right now, I am in my third semester, and my CGPA is 8.53. Before
            college, I
            scored 84.7% in my 12th grade and 92% in my 10th grade. I work hard to keep improving in my studies, and I
            hope to
            continue learning and doing well in my courses.
        </p>
        <p>I have developed a solid understanding of programming through my coursework and personal projects. I am
            proficient in
            languages like Python, C, C++, and Java, and I also have a basic knowledge of web technologies such as
            <mark>HTML,
                CSS, and
                JavaScript</mark>. Using these skills, I created an Amazon Clone project to apply what I have learned in
            real-world scenarios.
            My goal is to become a <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong> at a leading multinational company, and
            I am
            dedicated to achieving
            this by consistently improving my coding skills. I make it a point to practice and learn something new each
            day to
            stay
            on track toward reaching my career goals.</p>
